## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add hello to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:stripe_eventex, "~> 1.0.0}]
        end

  2. Ensure hello is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:hello]]
        end
